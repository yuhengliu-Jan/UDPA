This platform is for UAV to cover the ground node simulation. 
map_inf.tcl file is a Manhattan grid of buildings and streets established by IUT-R parameters in different urban environments.
The analytic geometry method is used to determine whether the communication link between UAV and ground nodes is blocked by obstacles.
You can open different altitude simulation experiments under a-300m-สตั้.py series files.
